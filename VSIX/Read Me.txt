Update: 2.21.2022
Run DataTier.Net to install the templates.

These templates will install the .NET Framework project templates for a VS 2019 project.

These templates have been updated to .NET Framework 4.8. I tried to create an install for VS 2022, and kept running into problems, and I 
do not create new .NET Framework projects any more. I wanted this just to have a release version of DataTier.NET.

Hopefully everything works.
