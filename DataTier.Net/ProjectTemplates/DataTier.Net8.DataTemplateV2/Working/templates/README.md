DataTier.NET8.ClassLibrary Version2 is a set of project templates for creating a DataTier.Net project targeting .NET8.

Version 2 combines the four projects into 2 projects. I moved the DataGateway and ApplicationLogicComponents classes into
the DataAccessComponent. The ultimate goal is to get the project down to just the Object Library, and move the DataAccessComponent logic into a Data File that 
can be processed. I am first combining down to two projects as this seems simpler. Then from their I will work on a 1 project version for the templates.

More info about DataTier.Net is available here:

Update 1.3.2024: Moved to a two project data tier template. I am now modifying DataTier .Net to handle both the 4 project version and the two.
Once finished with this update, I may see if I can write a converter to convert the four project templates to a two project structure.

Update 11.18.2023: This template is for creating a DataTier.Net project targeting .NET 8.
