Update 7.14.2019: I now have a VSIX installer that makes it easier to install the templates.

DataTier.Net\VSIX\DataTier.Net.ProjectTemplates.Installer.vsix

--

Update 5.27.2019: There was a problem with the NuGet paths if I include the reference in the templates, so after opening right click your solution > Manager NuGet Packages for Solution.

Search DataJuggler.Net, and this will resolve the issue. I am too tired to keep working on this now as I have to work in the morning.


To install into Visual Studio 2017 or 2019, Copy the file DataTier.Net.ClassLibrary.zip to the following directory.


VS 2017
C:\Users\[Your User Name]\Documents\Visual Studio 2017\Templates\ProjectTemplates\Visual C#

And / Or

VS 2019
C:\Users\[Your User Name]\Documents\Visual Studio 2019\Templates\ProjectTemplates\Visual C#


Note: You can install these templates into older version of Visual Studio by selecting the path for that version.

Be warned the new templates have only been tested on Visual Studio 2019, as I no longer have VS 2017.


The product DataTier.Net was based RAD Studio Code Generation Toolkit worked as far back as 2008, and the product RAD Studio
was based on DataClassBuilder.Net worked as far back as 2005. 

The templates use DOT NET Framework 4.61. If you need a different version you can change that by selecting the Project in 
Solution Explorer and clicking Properties and select the version that suits your needs.

Version 4.61 is the only tested version of the current release, but the marjoirty of this code has worked for over a decade and is 
fairly well tested since the majority of my day jobs have all used this product in Test and Production.

There are no guaruntees that it will be bug free, or that it will work for you. It works for the databases I create and / or have to 
support for my personal projects and my clients projects.

The folder DataTier.Net.DataTemplate is the uncompressed zip file. I use this to edit and create the project templates and zip files.
