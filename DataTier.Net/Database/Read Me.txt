Update 12.23.2021: I modified the Project table, so run the Update Target Framework.sql if you are upgrading from a previous version.

Update 12.24.2020: I added 2 new tables and 1 new field to the database.

New field UIFolder was added to the Projects table.

Two new tables:
UIField
UserInterface

I am working on a new user interface designer, so I hope to be able to create data editors for Window Forms and Blazor to save some of the work of creating new projects.

If you are new to DataTier.Net, create a new SQL Server database and then execute the SQL Script DataTier.Net.Database.Schema.sql, located in the 
Database\SQL Scripts folder of this project.

Existing Users:

Run the UpdatedProjectsTableAndAddUserInterfaceAndUIFieldTables.sql and then execute the stored proc UpdatedStoredProcedures.sql and your database will be up to date.

This change was needed to create a new UI Builder.

Update 6.1.2019: I now have DataTier.Net as its own repo.

I may a decision to make the download smaller, I now only include the SQL Scripts to create the database.
I was providing the option to attach the database, but this adds 5 megs to the download and makes
it a little harder on my to produce updates.

Sorry if this is a problem, but smaller downloads should make it easier to use.

Also now all of the referenced files are referenced via NuGet packages.

If you need the source code to any of the NuGet packages, the Data Juggler Shared Repo still contains
all the source files. I do plan on eventually moving each project to thier own repo, but this takes time.

--

In the DataTier.Net.StoredProcedures.sql file, the last procedure 'UpdateProcPermissions' is an optional stored procedure.

It is useful to grant permission to a SQL Server Login to execute all the stored procedures in a table. 

I am not the author and I wish I knew who the original creator is to give them credit. Use it if you find it useful.
